# OpenGL Test README #

This repository is comprised of a set of OpenGL programs designed explicitly for testing functionality as well as acquainting the developers with the API, its concepts, and its various implementations.

### What is this repository for? ###

* This project is under heavy development and will, in all likelihood, not come to full fruition. Instead, a new repository will be created once the developers have been sufficiently educated and inspired.
* Please keep discussions on DonutDev's channels on HipChat
