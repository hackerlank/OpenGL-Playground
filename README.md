# OpenGL Test README #

This repository is comprised of a set of OpenGL programs designed explicitly for testing functionality as well as acquainting the developers with the API, its concepts, and its various implementations.

### What is this repository for? ###

* This project is under heavy development and will, in all likelihood, not come to a conclusive fruition. Instead, a separate repository will be created once the developers have been sufficiently educated and inspired by these learning exercises.

### Important Notes ###

* Please keep discussions within DonutDev's channels on [HipChat](https://donutdev.hipchat.com/rooms/show/978080/donutdev).
* When modifying content, make sure to create new branches, submit a PR, and then merge the remote branch. The only exception to this should be plain-text files such as the README and the contributors file. Under normal circumstances, you should **not** push commits directly to the main branch.
* Use the [Issue Tracker](https://bitbucket.org/donutdev/opengl-test/issues?status=new&status=open) for filing bug reports, requesting features, or submitting formal proposals.
